ALGO
1. maintain an in-memory counter per node
2. synchronise access to the in-memory counter (so that node's goroutines don't get stale values)
3. store the in-memory counter in a key pertaining to that specific node
4. at every read, nodes perform a read on every key in the KV and adds it together
